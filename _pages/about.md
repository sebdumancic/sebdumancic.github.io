*How can we make machines learn from as little data as possible?*<br/>
*How can we make machines that effectively deploy their knowledge in novel situations?*

I try to answer these questions by investigating how can we use programming languages to represent what artificially intelligence agents know and how they act.
In pursuing this goal, I work on *program synthesis*, which focuses on learning programs from examples, and *probabilistic programming*, which focuses on representing and reasoning with probabilistic models represented as computer programs.
In both fields, representing knowledge as a program is the key feature that allows us to capture knowledge of arbitrary complexity, use it flexibly, and acquire it from little experience.

I am also interested in application of program synthesis and probabilistic programming in scientific discovery (especially geophysics), transportation, robotics and planning.

Before joining TU Delft, I was an  FWO-funded postdoctoral fellow in the [DTAI lab](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) at KU Leuven working with Hendrik Blockeel and Luc De Raedt, where I also obtained my PhD.
I was a visiting researcher at MIT, University of Oxford, and NEC Laboratories Europe.
